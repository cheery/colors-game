# Colors -game

[http://cheery.github.io/colors-game/](Play the game).

I played at the [http://sleepysort.github.io/colors/](sleepysort's Colors -game) and got fairly annoyed for not being able to win. On [the github page](https://github.com/sleepysort/colors) he says the game was made in 5 hours using Construct 2. Obviously it's meant to be easier that way.

I wrote this thing in 2 hours 30 minutes. Actually it took 30 minutes to improve the playability so making the game took 2 hours.
